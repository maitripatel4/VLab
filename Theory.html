        <h2 align = "center">Why do we need to measure hardness of water?</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water contains many dissolved minerals and salts. Some contributes in a positive manner to biological animals while some 
            in a negative manner. Some even harms our body cells and gets accumulated into our body in form of stone which needs to be
            operated upon and removed! <b> According to one report, hard water causes skin irritation when it comes into direct contact 
            of human body.</b> Hardwater is safe to drink , but using it over a long time can lead to problems like
            <ul>
                <li>Strains in skin</li>
                <li>Water appliances work harder, resulting in higher water bills</li>
                <li>Spots appear on clothes and linens</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <img align="right" src="Hardwater.jpg" alt="Hardwater effect on tap" width="300" height="200">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also causes damage to hair. According to report of <b>2016</b> which was been generated based on the experiment conducted
            on 15 women who were asked to use hard and soft water for their hair wash for 30 days, found out that hard water decreased
            their hair thickness and hindered their hair growth along with ruffled appearance. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some additional symptoms noticed were:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Breakage</li>
                <li>Thinning</li>
                <li>Tangles</li>
                <li>Dry Scalp</li>
                <li>Dullness</li>
                <li>Brassiness or a Green Hue</li>
                <li>Frizzness</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It not only damages human body, it also causes rupture to machine parts on which it is being used for cooling
            or for any other production purpose. It forms solid deposits comprised of mainly calcium and magnesium salts and can damage
            equipments, while soft water may be corrosive and therefore it is important measuring and knowing levels of hardness in your
            process water <b>in order to maintain balance between corrosivity and scaling.</b>
        </p>
        <h2 align = "center">What is Hardness of water?</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardness of Water is due to presence of soluble bicarbonates, chlorides and sulphates of calcium and 
            magnesium. Water which doesn't give lather with soap is hard water. It has high mineral contents. As it doens't produce lather
            with soap, it is not suitable for laundry purpose.<br>
            <!-- <img align="right" src="Hardness_Temp_Perm.png" alt="Temporary and Permanent Hardness" width="400" height="200"> -->
            <b>There are two types of Hardness:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Temporary Hardness: Presence of magnesium and calcium carbonates make water temporarily hard.</li>
                <li>Permanent Hardness: Presence of soluble salts in form of chlorides and sulphates in water make it hard.</li>

                <br>i.e, 1 ppm = 1 part of CaCO<sub>3</sub> equivalent to hardness in 106 parts of water.</li>
            <li><b>Miligram per litre</b>: Is the number of milligrams of CaCO3 equivalent hardness present per litre of water. Thus:<br>

                1<sup>o</sup>Clarke = 1 grain of CaCO<sub>3</sub> equivalent hardness per gallon of water.

        <h2 align="center">Alkalinity</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alkalinity is an aggregate property of the water sample which measures acid neutralizing capacity of water.
           It can be interpreted in terms specific substances only when a complete chemical composition of the sample is also performed. 
           The alkalinity of surface water is due to the carbonate, bicarbonate and hydroxide content and is often interpreted in terms 
           of the concentrations of these constituents.<br><b>Higher the alkalinity, greater is the capacity of water to neutralize acids. 
           Conversely, the lower the alkalinity, the lesser will be the neutralizing capacity.</b>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To detect the alkalinity, the water is tested  for phenolphathalein and total alkalinity, using
            Equations;<br>
            <img align="center" src="Equations alkalinity.png" alt="Equations or Formulas" class="flopped"><br>
            where<br>
            A = titrant(mL) used to the titrate to pH 8.3<br>
            B = titrant (mL) used to titrate to pH 4.5 <br>
            N = normality of the acid (0.02N H2SO4 for this alkalinity test)<br>
            50,000 = a conversion factor to change the normality into units of CaCO3<br>
            Once these PA and TA are calculated , the three types of alkalinities i.e. hydroxide, carbonates and bicarbonates can be
            calculated from the following table:<br>
            <table align="center" >
